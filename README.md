# Face Recognition

This project is a real-time face recognition system built with Python, OpenCV, and the `face_recognition` library.

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Add images of known individuals to the `person/` folder.

   - Filenames should correspond to the person's name (e.g., john.jpg).

3. Run the program:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. Press `q` to close the webcam window.

## Folder Structure

- `main.py` — main script
- `person/` — folder containing images of known faces
- `requirements.txt` — list of required Python libraries
